PyPy -- PyPy is a Python interpreter and just-in-time compiler. PyPy
focuses on speed, efficiency and compatibility with the original
CPython interpreter.  PyPy started out as a Python interpreter
written in the Python language itself. Current PyPy versions are
translated from RPython to C code and compiled. The PyPy JIT (short
for "Just In Time") compiler is capable of turning Python code into
machine code at run time.  PyPy has a "stackless mode" that supports
microthreads.

Stackless -- A Python programming language interpreter, so named
because it avoids depending on the C call stack for its own stack.
The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid
much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads.
In addition to Python features, Stackless also adds support for
coroutines, communication channels and task serialization.

Python 3.x (currently 3.3) -- Python 2.7.x code is not upward
compatible with Python 3.x, but there is a conversion tool (2to3) to
assist with the conversion process.

Summary of Python versions:

- IronPython -- Python running on .NET
- Jython -- Python running on the Java Virtual Machine
- PyPy -- A fast python implementation with a JIT compiler
- Stackless Python -- Branch of CPython supporting microthreads
- CPython -- We will be using v. 2.7.5 or v. 2.7.6.
