Write a function that takes a file name as its argument, opens the
file in read mode, and counts and prints the number of lines in the
file.

Then call your function with a file name that exists and one that
does not.  Find out which specific exception is produced with that
non-existent file.  Write a ``try:except:`` statement around your
function calls that protects you from that specific exception.
