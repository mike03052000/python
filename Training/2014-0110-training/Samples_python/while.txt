Create a single linked list (for example, 2-tuples).  Then:

1. Write a recursive function that walks the single linked list.

2. Write a function that uses a ``while`` statement to walk the
   single linked list.

3. Write a function that uses a generator function (containing
   ``yield``) in a ``for:`` statement to walk the single linked
   list.

Create a pattern string and a target string that contains the
pattern in several locations, for example::

    pat = 'abc'
    target = '11abc22abc33abc44'

Then:

1. Write a function that uses a ``while:`` statement to find and
   print all the positions of the sub-string in the target string.

2. Write a function that uses a ``for:`` statement and a generator
   function (containing ``yield``) to find and print all the
   positions of the sub-string in the target string.
