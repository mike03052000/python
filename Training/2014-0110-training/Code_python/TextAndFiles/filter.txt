=====================================
 Filter -- Implementing Text Filters
=====================================

1. Implement a Python script that reads standard input (stdin) and
   writes to standard output (stdout).

2. Write a function that reads all lines from standard input, performs
   a transformation on each line, and writes each line to standard
   output.

3. Write several functions that either filter or transform a single
   line.  This function should take one argument (a string). It should
   return a string or None (if the line is to be skipped).

   Here are a few possible filters:

   - Select all lines that contain "def" or "class".

   - Select all non-empty lines, that is, lines that (1) have a length
     greater than zero and (2) contain characters other than
     whitespace.

   Here are a few possible transformations:

   - Insert "## " at the beginning of each line.

   - Remove "## " from the beginning of each line.

   - Center the line (for example, within a width of 80 columns).

4. Pass your single-line function to the function that reads from
   standard input and writes to standard output.


What you will learn:

- How to write a text filter.

- How to read from standard input and write to standard output.

- How to perform several formatting and transformation tasks on
  strings.

- How to use polymorphism in Python.  Specifically, how to write a
  function that takes a function as an argument, provided that the
  function satisfies an interface.
