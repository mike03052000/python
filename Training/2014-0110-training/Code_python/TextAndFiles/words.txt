============
 Word count
============

1. Write a script that counts the number of occurrences of each word
   in a text file.

2. Print out the word and its count for each word in the document.

3. Print out the total word count and the total line count.

Additional tasks:

- Format the words and counts so that words are left-aligned
  and the counts are right aligned in columns.

- Print the word counts with the words sorted in alphabetic order.

- Also display a count of the number of lines.

- Skip all lines that begin with a "#" character.

- Quit processing lines when you find a specific string in a line.


What you will learn:

- How to open a text file and read the lines in it.

- How to split a line/string into "words".

- How to collect totals in a complex data structure (probably a
  dictionary).
