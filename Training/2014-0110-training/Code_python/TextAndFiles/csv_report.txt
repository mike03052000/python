===============================
 Comma separated values report
===============================

1. Read a text file containing comma separated values (CSVs).  For
   input data see csv_report.csv.

2. Print a report of the values in the input file.  Split each line
   into comma separated values fields.  Left align the name and
   description columns; right align the ratings column.

3. Ignore all lines that begin with a hash ("#").

Ditto, but use the ``csv`` module to parse the input (instead of
``str.split()``).
