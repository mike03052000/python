A File Object with Newline Strip
================================

A class with a has-a relationship to a file object
==================================================

Implement a class that "wraps" a file object.  In your class:

- The constructor should open the file and save the file object.

- A ``readline()`` method should strip newlines from each line it
  reads.

- A ``close()`` method closes the file object.
