# Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
# But she doesn't have a lot to say
# Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
# But she changes from day to day
# 
# I want to tell her that I love her a lot
# But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
# Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
# Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah,
# Someday I'm going to make her mine.
