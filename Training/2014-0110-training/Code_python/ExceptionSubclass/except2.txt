===================================
Exceptions -- raising and catching
===================================

1. Define an exception sub-type SpecialExp.

2. Implement the following functions:

   - inner2() -- raise an exception of type SpecialExp.

   - inner1() -- call inner2.

   - outer -- call inner1.  Wrap this call in a try:except: 
     statement that catches exception SpecialExp and only that
     specific exception.

3. Run your script.

4. In inner1 or inner2, generate another exception, for
   example, by referencing an undefined variable.

5. Run your script again.  Make sure that only SpecialExp
   is caught.

6. Add another clause to your try:except: statement -- Catch
   the additional exception.


What you will learn:

- How to define an exception type.

- How to raise an exception of a specific type.

- How to catch an exception of a specific type (and no other).
