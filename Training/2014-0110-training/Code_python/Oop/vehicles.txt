=========================================================
 Classes and sub-classes -- the vehicles class hierarchy
=========================================================

1. Implement Python classes for the following class hierarchy::

       Vehicle
           Truck
               PickupTruck
               BigRig
           Automobile
               Van
               Sedan
       PassengerStop

2. Support each of the following:

   - All vehicles should have instance variables ID (string) and fuel
     (integer).

   - All Trucks should have a wheel_count (integer).

   - All BigRigs have a maximum load and a current load (both integers).

   - Vans should have a passenger count and a maximum number of
     passengers (integers).  Vans should also have a route (a list of
     instances of class PassengerStop).

   - Every class in the Vehicle class hierarchy should implement a
     "show" method, which displays information about the instance.
     When implementing the show method in sub-classes, consider
     calling the show method of the super-class.

   - A PassengerStop has a location (a string) and a number of
     passengers (an integer).

3. Create several instances of your classes.  Then display information
   from those instances.  For example:

   - Display the fuel and number of wheels of a BigRig.

   - Display the fuel, the number of passengers, maximum number of
     passengers, and route of a Van.


What you will learn:

- How to define a Python class.

- How to implement a sub-class of a class.

- How to implement the constructor method of a class.

- How to call the constructor of a super-class.

- How to call a method in the same class (or a super-class).

- How to call a method in a super-class, by-passing the same method in
  the current class.

- How to override a method in a superclass.

- How to iterate over a list of instances and call a method on each
  instance.
