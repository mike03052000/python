============================================
Cartesian Points and Calculations on Points
============================================

1. Define a class ``Point`` with two member variables: ``x`` and
   ``y``.

2. Define a class ``RGBPoint`` that extends (sub-classes) class
   ``Point`` and which adds the following:

   - An instance variable ``color`` (along with getter and setter
     methods).

   - A method named ``describe`` that returns a string giving the
     ``x``, ``y``, and ``color`` of the ``RGBPoint``.

3. Define a class ``CalculatingPoint`` that extends (sub-classes)
   class ``RGBPoint`` with the following methods:

   - ``difference`` -- calculate the distance between
     two points

   - ``sum`` -- calculate the sum (addition) of two points.

4. Using your ``difference`` and ``sum`` methods, implement the
   minus (dash) and plus (+) operators.

5. Modify your ``Point`` class so that ``x`` and ``y`` are
   properties.


What you will learn:

- How to define a class.

- How to implement a sub-class.

- How to implement methods that define the behaviors and
  capabilities of a class.

- How to implement an operator.

- How to implement a property.
