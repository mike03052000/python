=========================
Exercises -- Decorators
=========================

Write a function that can be applied as a decorator.  When applied,
this decorator (wrapper) function show trace calls to the functions
to which it is applied.  Specifically:

- Before execution of the function, the decorator should print a
  message showing the function name and arguments.

- The decorator should execute/call the function.  It should pass in
  all arguments.  It should return the value returned by the
  decorated function.

- After execution of the decorated function, the decorator should
  print a message showing that the function has returned/exited.

What you will learn:

- How to write a nested function, a closure, actually.

- How to implement a function that can be used as a decorator.
