 cmd -- Command Line Interface
===============================

1. Write an application that implements a command line interface using
   the ``cmd`` module in that Python standard library.

2. Your command line interface should respond to the following
   commands:

   - ``hello`` -- Print a "hello" message and display any arguments on
     the command line.

   - ``quit`` -- Exit the command loop and quit the application.

3. Provide documentation for both commands in a doc string.

4. Test your application:

   - Type the "hello" and "quit" commands at the command prompt.

   - Type "help" and the "help hello" to view documentation on your
     commands.


What you will learn:

- How to use the ``cmd`` module from the Python standard library.

- How to implement a text mode, command line interface.

- How to add a doc string to a method/function.
