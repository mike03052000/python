=================================
Unit test framework -- exercise
=================================

The file ``unit_tests_lib.py`` contains several functions:
``fetch_rows`` and ``fetch_column``, which need a test harness.

1. Write a test class (a subclass of ``unittest.TestCase``) that provides two
   tests, one for each of these functions.
   
   You can use the file ``data1.db`` as a test database.  Find out
   about its contents by running the following::

       $ python unit_tests_lib.py data1.db

   When you call ``fetch_column``, you will need the name of one of
   the columns in this database.  The column names are "name",
   "desc", and "cat".

2. Create and load a test suite using the ``unittest`` framework.

3. Run your test suite from the command line.

What you will learn:

- How to create a set of tests in a ``unittest`` class.

- How to test for success or failure.

- How to load a test suite.

- How to run the tests in a test suite.
