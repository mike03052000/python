============
 dom4j walk
============

Note: Parts of this exercise is very similar to the minidom walk
exercise, but requires that you use dom4j instead of minidom.

1. Use the dom4j Java class library to read an XML document.  The
   dom4j jar file is under Materials/Libraries/dom4j-1.6.1. See
   people.xml for a sample XML document.

2. Walk the DOM tree.
   
3. For each node in the tree, print out (1) the element (tag)
   name, (2) the attributes of the node (name and value), and (3)
   text content of the node.

4. Modify the tree.  For example, add a date attribute to each
   "person" element.  Then, walk and display the tree again.

5. Use the dom4j XPath capability to retrieve a node in the tree,
   then modify that node.  For example, set the value of an attribute
   of the node.

6. Use the dom4j XPath capability to retrieve a list of nodes in the
   tree, then modify each node in the list.  For example, set the
   value of an attribute of the node.
