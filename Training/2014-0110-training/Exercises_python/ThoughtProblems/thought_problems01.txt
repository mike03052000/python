Thought problems
==================

Specify which data structures and what algorithm you might use to
solve each of the following:

- Count the lines in a file.

- Count the number of unique (non-equal) lines in a file.

- Count the number of occurances of each different word in a file.

- Print out all the lines in a file in alphabetical order.

- Print out all the unique lines in a file in alphabetical order.

- Each line in a file begins with a 6 digit ID number.  Process
  (print) each line in the file *but* skip any line after you have
  seen that ID number.  Also, skip all blank lines.

- Ditto, but process the *last* line for any lines that have the
  same ID number.

- Given this regular expression pattern ``"#\((.*?)\)"`` and data
  file ``data02.txt``, solve each of the following:

  - Process each line in a file that contains a pattern.

  - Ditto, but process each of the lines in alphabetical order.

  - Ditto, but process each of the lines in alphabetical order by the
    pattern found.
