Dictionaries -- exercises
===========================

Write and call a function that does each of the following:

1. Create an empty dictionary.  Print it.

2. Create a dictionary with two initial keys and values.  Print it.

3. Create another dictionary with several entries, then update it
   with the items from the previous dictionary.

4. Print (1) the keys, (2) the values, and (3) the items from one of
   your dictionaries.

5. Print the length of (number of items in) your dictionary.

6. Iterate over the keys in your dictionary, printing the key and
   its associated value.  Remember that the dictionary itself is
   an iterator (iteratable? iterable?).

7. Get the value associated with a key in your dictionary or None if
   the dictionary does not contain that key.  Print them.

8. Given a list of 2-tuples ``[(key1, value1), ...]``, create a
   dictionary whose keys and values are ``key1`` and ``value1`` etc.

What you will learn:

- How to create dictionaries.

- How to add (insert) items into a dictionary.

- How to access the keys, values, and items in your dictionaries.
