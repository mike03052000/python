====================
Files -- exercises
====================

1. Write a function that takes a file name as its argument, opens
   the file (in read mode), and reads and prints each line in the
   file.  Don't forget to close the file.

2. Write a function that takes a filename as its argument, opens the
   file (in read mode), and counts the words in the file.

   Optionally, accumulate a count of each different word.  Then
   print the count for each word in alphabetical order.

3. Write a function that takes (1) a file name and (2) a list of
   strings as its arguments, opens the file in *write* mode, and
   writes each item in the list as a line in the file.

4. Write a function that takes the following arguments: (1) a file
   name and (2) a transform function.  Open the file in read mode,
   read each line, apply the transform function to the line, and
   print the line.
   
   The transform function should take one argument (a string).  This
   function should transform that string (for example convert it to
   upper case), and return the transformed string.  

5. Write a script that takes its input from stdin and writes its
   output to stdout.  Transform that content is some way, for
   example, (1) convert it to upper case or (2) add "## " at the
   beginning of each line.

6. Write a function that takes a file name as its argument, opens
   the file (in read mode), and then:

   - read 4 bytes and print it
   - read another 4 bytes and print it
