===================
Sets -- exercises
===================

1. Given a list (for example, ``range(5)``), create a set from that
   list.

2. Given a list that contains duplicates (for example, ``[11, 22,
   11, 33, 22]``), create a list that has the duplicates removed.

3. Given these two lists::

       list1 = range(0, 10)
       list2 = range(8, 20)

   Using sets, test for membership in:

   - ``list1`` or ``list2``
   - ``list1`` and ``list2``
   - ``list1`` but not ``list2``
   - ``list1`` or ``list2`` but not both

4. Your wise and helpful instructor has told you that a set does not
   contain the same object more than once.  Therefore, sets must use
   some test for "sameness".  Your task is to find out whether sets
   test for "sameness" using the equality relationship (operator
   ``==``) or using the identity relationship (operator ``is``), and
   then prove it.
