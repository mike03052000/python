Class methods and static methods -- exercise
==============================================

Define a class.  In your class, do the following:

1. Define a class variable named ``class_description`` whose initial
   value is "A test for class methods and static methods".

2. Define a class method named ``show_description`` -- Print out the
   class variable ``class_description``.

3. Define a static method named ``show_time`` -- Print out the
   current time.

Write a test harness (a function) for the above Class.  In your test
function: (1) do **not** create an instance of your class; (2)
call the class method and the static method in that class; (3)
change the value of the class variable; (4) call the class method
again to prove that the class variable has changed.


What you will learn:

1. How to define and use a class variable.

2. How to define and use a class method.

3. How to define and use a static method.
